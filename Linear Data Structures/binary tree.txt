Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children.
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children,we typically name them the left and right child.

A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node (commonly known as the “root”) of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. 
Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts:
1. Data 
2. Pointer to left child 
3. Pointer to right child 

Basic Operation On Binary Tree : 

-Inserting an element
-Removing an element 
-Searching for an element 
-Traversing the tree
